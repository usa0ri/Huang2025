# Overview

Ribo-seq analysis for Huang et al.

# Requirements

All the environment of the analysis steps were devloped as docker images.

Host requirements:

+ Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
+ Docker version 25.0.5
+ VScode version 1.80.2 with the following extensions:
  + Dev Containers v0.299.0
  + Docker v1.26.0

# Contents

## Preprocessing

`preprocessing/`

Adapter removal, rRNA mapping, and mRNA mapping of the reads.

All the steps were done in a docker image defined in `preprocessing/dockerfile`.

A custom reference transcriptome was generated by the code in `preprocessing/ref`.

## DEG analysis

`DEG/`

DEG analysis by edgeR (3.40.1).

This was performed in a docker image defined in `DEG/dockerfile`.

The input count data was generated by a custom python code in `riboseq/Shiying.py`.

## Ribo-seq analysis

`riboseq/`

Generating count data and making figures.

All the steps were done in a remote container of VScode defined in `riboseq/devcontainer`

The figures were made by a custom python code under `riboseq/`.
